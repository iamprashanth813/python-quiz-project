This is a simple Python command-line quiz application that asks the user a series of multiple-choice questions and calculates the final score. 
The program stores questions, options, and correct answers in a list of dictionaries, then displays each question one by one with four choices (A, B, C, D). 
The user enters their answer through the keyboard, and the program checks it against the correct option. 
For every correct response, the score is increased, and at the end, the total score is displayed out of the number of questions. 
This project demonstrates basic Python concepts such as functions, lists, dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling in an interactive way.
